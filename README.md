This is the code for www.mattgarvin.com

## DESCRIPTION
This is a dead simple website I am making to showcase my front end skills.

There are two markdown files:  
* README.md is for where we left off at, and what to do next.  
  This should be short and concise!
* NOTES.md is for longer stuff (often mentioned in this README)...

## LEFT OFF
* ?

## NEXT STEPS
* ?
